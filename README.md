# chrome-disable-csp

### Disable Content-Security-Policy Extension

This extension is designed for developers and testers who need to temporarily disable Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers while analyzing web applications. When the extension icon is colored <img src="src/icons/icon16.png" alt="icon">, CSP headers are disabled.

⚠️ Warning: Use this extension at your own risk. Disabling CSP headers removes a critical security feature that helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This tool should only be used in a testing or development environment and not for regular browsing or on production sites.

### Features:
- Easy Toggle: Click the extension icon to disable CSP headers. Click again to re-enable them.
